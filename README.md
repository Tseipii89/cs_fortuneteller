# cs_fortuneteller (WIP)
AI project to predict cs:go match results


## Summary
The cs_fortuneteller predicts the winner of cs games. It takes input (future matches, statistics) from HLTV and based on the team composition, player statistics and other available info, calculates the winner.



## Background
The project is my personal attempt to try do something harder just to see where my current skills are. I like the idea because it will use some AI techonology (or then not, I'm not sure at this point).
