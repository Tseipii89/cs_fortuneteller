## What AI model and how to implement it?

I had no idea how or what kind of AI model to implement. I had have one AI course during the computer science bachelor degree, but for this task I don't think it helped a lot. So I went to studying.

* [Building AI Course](https://buildingai.elementsofai.com/). BuildingAI was the first stop. I wanted to get a rough idea of what to except. I did the advanced path and got some ideas (I think most importantly to try different things and see what works), but I still had no idea what to do
 * I noticed that I don't know linear algebra well enough. Linear algebra seems to be the sh*t in machine learning and AI. If I truly want to undestand the principles I really need to understand the vector and matrices calculations (and other mathematics) behind it all. So I decided check the [Mathematics for Machine Learning](https://mml-book.github.io/) <-- this is what I'm currently learning.
